# Code-Quiz

This is a JavaScript quiz project I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When you click start, you are presented with five multiple choice questions with an overall time limit of 60 seconds.
If you answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

At the end of the quiz you are presented with your score and a prompt to enter in your initials and a submit button.

When you have submitted your score, you will go to the score board, there you are presented with your score and the options to restart or clear score.
